### About Project

This project was a project I was invited to do for a job application. I had to finish within 1 week. The requirements were:

 - View a list of to-do items with the ability to filter the list by pending, complete, and all to-dos

- Create new to-do item

- Edit a to-do item

- Delete a to-do item

- Complete a to-do item

This project is hosted on Firebase and can be found at [link](https://react-todo-69761.web.app/).
